## Fundamentals of QGIS
### Map making in an open source environment

#HSLIDE
## Unique?
* It's the best GIS & graphic design software for those unique cartographic effects,
* tightly integrated with OpenStreetMap, the wikipedia of maps,
* an integration of different programs/libraries that vastly extend functionality,
* and, oh, and it's all free to use for whatever you want! 

#HSLIDE
## Strolling?
* More like sprawling.
* The [instructions](https://github.com/boydx/qgis) are mostly screenshots and commands and could be seen as two, or even three, unique lessons. It needs a little housekeeping.
* Since we'll be strolling together, we'll see how far we can get in a day.


#HSLIDE
